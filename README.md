# My Angular Learning App

This project is part of my learning journey with Angular. I'm using this to explore the framework's core features like components, routing, services, directives, and pipes.

## 📁 Project Structure (in progress)

- `components/` – Reusable UI components
- `directives/` – Custom Angular directives
- `home/` – Homepage-related logic
- `model/` – Interfaces and data models
- `pipes/` – Custom pipes
- `services/` – Shared logic and data services
- `todos/` – Todo feature implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```

npm install
